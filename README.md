### Hello, I'm Jaime! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer with experience building apps in Ruby on Rails and React. I'm currently working as a **Tech Lead** at Vaco for Google Trust & Safety where I manage a team of application developers and graphic (UI/UX) designers.

I graduated from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2021 with my Bachelor of Arts in Biology. In late 2021 after leaving a job in healthcare, I started to teach myself coding and discovered a passion for technology. I would describe myself as highly self-motivated and a quick learner who loves learning about new technology stacks.
